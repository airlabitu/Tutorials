# Measuring weight with load cells and arduino
With this code we provide a *bare-minimum* example for getting started with load cells. The code is tested using a single 20kg load cell in a kitchen-scale-style setup. The programming will tare the weight when started and following request a calibration weighing of 500 "units" or grams. Full documentation and wiring diagrams can be fouind via [this link](https://airlab.itu.dk/measuring-load-cells-with-arduino/) to AIR LABs webpage
