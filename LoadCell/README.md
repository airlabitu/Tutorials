# Measuring Sound Level inputs via Arduino and a KY-037 Module
In this code example we display how you can measure sound levels with an Arduino dynamically, and/or set a threshold that produces digital HIGH/LOW values. Full documentation and wiring diagrams can be found via [this link](https://airlab.itu.dk/measuring-sound-level-with-ky-037-and-arduino/) to AIR LABs webpage
